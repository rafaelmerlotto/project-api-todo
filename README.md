# Web app To Do List

This is a web app to do list with simple functions. There is a textfield to write your tasks and a button to save it, on each task there is a button to delete it.

The backend was developed in Node, I used Typescript, Express.js to create the API and Prisma to access the database.

The frontend was developed in React, with the Typescript.

## Getting started

Run the development server:

`npm run dev`

Run the app in the development mode.

`npm run start`

Open [http://localhost:3000] to view it in your browser.
